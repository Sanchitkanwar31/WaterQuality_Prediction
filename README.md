##  Project Summary

* Predicts O‚ÇÇ, NO‚ÇÉ‚Åª, NH‚ÇÑ‚Å∫ using ML models
* Trained on historical water quality data
* Detects potential safety issues early
* Enables smarter environmental monitoring
* Helps visualize chemical trends and their correlations
* Aims to support public health and environmental decision-making

##  Sample Dataset

| NH‚ÇÑ   | BSK5 | Suspended | O‚ÇÇ    | NO‚ÇÉ   | NO‚ÇÇ  | SO‚ÇÑ | PO‚ÇÑ  | CL   |
| ----- | ---- | --------- | ----- | ----- | ---- | --- | ---- | ---- |
| 0.33  | 2.77 | 12        | 12.3  | 9.5   | 0.05 | 154 | 0.45 | 289  |
| 0.044 | 3.00 | 51.6      | 14.61 | 17.75 | 0.03 | 352 | 0.09 | 1792 |

##  How It Works

1. Clean & encode data
2. Split dataset (80% training, 20% testing)
3. Train ML model (RandomForestRegressor)
4. Predict unknown pollutant levels
5. Evaluate performance (RMSE, MAE, R¬≤)

## ‚ñ∂ Running the App

To run this project using Streamlit:

```bash
cd src
streamlit run app.py
```

Ensure all dependencies are installed and the dataset is present in the correct path.
